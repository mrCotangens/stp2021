Thunder
Now you know
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh, oh, I'm radioactive, radioactive
A beating heart of stone

It's been a loveless year
The master of my sea, oh-ooh
Last things last
Just another product of today
Make your heart believe

I wage my war, on the world inside
Love you Ms. Cita, the son of a leader
Perfect paradise
Thunder, thunder, thun-
Now you know

It's been a loveless year
The master of my sea, oh-ooh
Last things last
Just another product of today
Make your heart believe

Thun-thun-thunder, thunder
To make it in this world
I can't breathe, I can't be
You're the face of the future, the blood in my veins, oh-ooh
Pain!

It's been a loveless year
The master of my sea, oh-ooh
Last things last
Just another product of today
Make your heart believe
